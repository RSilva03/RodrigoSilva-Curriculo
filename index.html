            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                During my exciting academic career in Computer Engineering at the renowned Faculty of Science and Technology at Universidade Nova de Lisboa,
                I plunged headlong into the fascinating world of technology. Right from the start, I was challenged to push the boundaries of my knowledge, 
                facing complex challenges and developing the skills needed to thrive in the field of computer science. Over the years, I have actively participated in innovative projects that have not only consolidated the
                theoretical concepts learnt in the classroom, but have also provided me with a practical and in-depth understanding
                of the practical applications in this field. I am keen to apply the knowledge acquired and skills developed throughout my academic career in professional
                contexts, contributing to innovative solutions and driving progress in the field of Computer Engineering.</p>

        <h2>Academic Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> <h3>Software Engineering</h3></li>  
            For a semester, our group of six was immersed in a challenging Open Source 
            project as part of our Software Engineering course.
            We met weekly to discuss individual progress, define tasks and elect a Scrum Master to lead the sprints. We 
            added incredible features to the application, such as rewards for completed 
            missions, improvements to the cart for transport and the ability to create points of 
            interest. Technologies such as IntelliJ IDEA and GitHub were used in this project.
            A video explaining the functionalities is available at:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/Th3LknIwn14."target="_blank">Explanation Video</a>. 
            This project used technologies such as IntelliJ IDEA (Java and XML) and GitHub.
            <li> <h3>Computer Networks</h3> </li>
            <p> In a collaborative project involving two people as part of the Computer Networks 
                course, we faced the complex challenge of transmitting video in a dynamic 
                network environment, where bandwidth and round-trip times are variable.  Inspired 
                by the DASH approach, we developed an application made up of three distinct 
                elements: the Content Server, full of films in various versions, the Player, 
                responsible for showing the films and the Proxy, a key part with producer and
                 consumer threads, optimising the fluid delivery of video segments.
                 The technology used in this project was Spyder (Python).
            </p>
            <li> <h3> Computer Graphics and Interfaces</h3> </li>
            This project, as part of the Computer Graphics and Interfaces course, aimed to 
            implement the Phong lighting model with fragment evaluation (Phong shading) 
            and use the dat.gui library for the graphical interface. We developed a scene 
            made up of 4 objects, allowing individual selection and modification (geometric 
            and material transformations), including geometry replacement. The user interface 
            was located in the top left-hand corner, making it easy to manipulate the selected 
            object.
            There was also a configuration of visualisation options such as back face 
            culling, z-buffering and control of the animation of the lights. In addition, the 
            application enabled adjustments to the perspective projection parameters (fovy, 
            near and far), as well as camera positioning and orientation. It had support for 
            three lights, with configuration options as point or directional light, allowing the 
            user to manipulate their characteristics (intensities). The position and orientation of 
            the light sources were choreographed by the application. The control interface for 
            the camera, lights and visualisation options was located in the top right-hand 
            corner. 
            The technology used in this project was VS Code (Javascript and HTML).

        <h2>Internships Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> <h3>Backend Development at Celfocus - NOVABASE</h3></li> 
            The application was designed with a focus on modularity and scalability, using 
            Java with the SpringBoot framework for the Backend. The Rest architecture 
            facilitates communication with the Frontend and other systems. Integration with 
            MongoDB as a NoSQL database allowed flexibility in data structuring and efficient 
            queries. The application adopted security practices such as JWT for authentication 
            and authorisation, as well as solid validations for data formats such as 
            email, mobile phone numbers, passwords and tax identification numbers (TINs). 
            The configuration of CI/CD pipelines ensured test automation and continuous 
            execution, while documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI made the endpoints 
            easier to understand and use. 
            This solution incorporated a Cache System to optimise the search for users and 
            orders. (orders.) This Cache System was implemented using Spring Boot Cache, 
            providing a significant improvement in the performance of frequent queries. With 
            the Cache System, the response time has decreased, allowing for a faster and 
            more efficient user experience. user experience. The implementation of the Cache 
            System included the configuration of expiry and invalidation policies, guaranteeing 
            invalidation policies, guaranteeing the consistency and updating of data. This 
            additional layer of the 
            Cache System is essential to support high-volume traffic scenarios and repeated 
            data access. 
            To guarantee the high availability and scalability of message processing, we used 
            Kafka. Kafka, as a distributed streaming platform, facilitated the acquisition, 
            processing and efficient storage of large volumes of data in real time.  The 
            integration of Kafka integration allowed the application to handle a large flow of 
            data while maintaining the integrity and performance of the services offered by the 
            application.  
            Finally, we deployed the solution to AWS, taking advantage of the scalable and 
            secure infrastructure of infrastructure. We used the Amazon Elastic Container 
            Registry (ECR) service, which made management easier, storage and deployment 
            of Docker container images. The use of ECR provided efficient integration with our 
            CI/CD pipelines, enabling continuous and agile delivery of application application 
            updates. We were left with two virtual machines, one dedicated to Kafka and the
